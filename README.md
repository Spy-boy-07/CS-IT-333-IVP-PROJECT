# CS-IT-333-IVP-PROJECT
Image Foreground Extraction and Background Replacement

## Overview

This project focuses on the task of image foreground extraction and subsequent background replacement. The primary techniques employed include global thresholding and morphological operations to enhance the accuracy of image segmentation. By combining these methods, the project aims to isolate foreground objects, remove unwanted noise, and create a visually appealing composition by replacing the background.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spy-boy-07/CS-IT-333-IVP-PROJECT.git
cd image-foreground-extraction
```

## Usage

To run the project and observe the foreground extraction and background replacement, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will initiate the project's main script and generate the output images demonstrating each step of the process.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
